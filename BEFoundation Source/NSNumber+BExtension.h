 @abstract Mathematical operations extension for NSNumber with type-safe arithmetic operations.
 @discussion This header provides a category extension for NSNumber that enables type-safe mathematical operations between NSNumber instances and primitive types. The extension preserves type precision and handles overflow detection for integer operations. It includes support for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), modulus operations, power operations, and bitwise XOR operations.
 
 The implementation uses a type precedence system to determine the appropriate return type based on the operands, ensuring that operations maintain the highest precision required by the input types.

 @category NSNumber(Extension)
 @abstract Mathematical operations extension for NSNumber.
 @discussion This category extends NSNumber with convenient methods for performing mathematical operations with other NSNumber instances or primitive types. All operations preserve type precision and handle overflow conditions appropriately.
 
 The methods are organized into two groups:
 - Operations with NSNumber instances (addNumber:, subtractNumber:, etc.)
 - Operations with primitive types (addInt:, addUInt:, addDouble:, etc.)
 
 Type precedence follows this order (lowest to highest):
 char, short, int, long, long long, BOOL, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, unsigned long long, float, double
