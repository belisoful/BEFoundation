 @abstract   Adds stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) operations to mutable collections.
 @discussion This header file provides categories on NSMutableArray and NSMutableOrderedSet
			 to enable stack-like and queue-like behaviors using common push, pop, and shift
			 method names. These extensions allow treating mutable collections as stacks
			 (Last-In, First-Out) or queues (First-In, First-Out) with intuitive method names.
