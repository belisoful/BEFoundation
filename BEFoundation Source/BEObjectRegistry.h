 @abstract      A thread-safe object registry system for managing object instances with UUID-based identification.
 @discussion    BEObjectRegistry provides a centralized system for registering and managing object instances using UUID-based identification. The registry maintains weak references to objects and provides thread-safe operations for registration, lookup, and management. Objects can be registered multiple times with reference counting, and the registry supports both automatic UUID generation and custom UUID provision through protocols.

The registry uses NSMapTable with weak references to avoid retain cycles, and provides comprehensive management capabilities including bulk operations and protocol-based filtering. All operations are thread-safe and designed for high-performance applications requiring object lifecycle management.

Example usage:
```objc
BEObjectRegistry *registry = [[BEObjectRegistry alloc] init];
MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
NSString *uuid = [registry registerObject:obj];
// Later retrieve the object, it must be retained outside the registry or it will be deallocated
MyObject *retrievedObj = [registry registeredObjectForUUID:uuid];
```

 @protocol      BERegistryProtocol
 @abstract      Protocol for objects that can be registered in a BEObjectRegistry.
 @discussion    Objects conforming to this protocol can be registered in the global registry system. The protocol provides read-only access to the object's registry state, including its UUID, registration count, and registration status. All properties are automatically managed by the registry system.
 
 The globalRegistryUUID property returns the UUID assigned to this object in the global registry, or nil if not registered. The globalRegistryCount indicates how many times this object has been registered (supports multiple registrations with reference counting). The isGlobalRegistered property provides a quick check for registration status.
 
 Objects can trigger registration and unregistration through the provided methods, which interact with the global registry instance.

 @discussion    BEUniversalObjectRegistry is a subclass of BEObjectRegistry that removes the protocol requirement restriction. Unlike the base BEObjectRegistry class, this registry can register any NSObject instance without requiring conformance to BERegistryProtocol.
 
				This registry is ideal for scenarios where you need to track objects that don't conform to specific protocols, such as third-party objects, system objects, or temporary objects that need centralized management.
 
				Key characteristics:
				- Accepts any NSObject instance for registration
				- Maintains weak references to prevent retain cycles
				- Inherits all thread-safety and reference counting features from BEObjectRegistry
				- Can be toggled to require protocol conformance via the requireRegistryProtocol property
				- Supports custom UUID generation through the CustomRegistryUUID protocol
 
				The registry maintains the same UUID generation and management features as the base class, including support for custom UUID objects and salt-based key generation for multi-registry scenarios.
 
				Example usage:
				```objc
				BEUniversalObjectRegistry *registry = [[BEUniversalObjectRegistry alloc] init];
				NSString *myString = @"Hello World";
				NSString *uuid = [registry registerObject:myString];
				NSString *retrievedString = [registry registeredObjectForUUID:uuid];
				```
 
				Warning: Since this registry uses weak references, objects must be retained elsewhere to prevent automatic deallocation and removal from the registry.

 @abstract      A registry that maintains strong references to registered objects for persistent storage.
 @discussion    BEStorageObjectRegistry is a subclass of BEUniversalObjectRegistry that uses strong references instead of weak references for value storage. This registry will retain all registered objects, preventing them from being deallocated until they are explicitly unregistered or the registry is cleared.
 
				This registry is designed for scenarios where you need guaranteed object persistence, such as:
				- Caching systems where objects must remain available
				- Object pools that manage reusable instances
				- Persistent storage systems that need to maintain object lifecycles
				- Scenarios where objects don't have other strong references
 
				Key characteristics:
				- Maintains strong references to all registered objects
				- Prevents automatic deallocation of registered objects
				- Inherits universal object acceptance from BEUniversalObjectRegistry
				- Objects are only deallocated when explicitly unregistered or registry is cleared
				- Ideal for object caching and persistent storage scenarios
 
				Memory management considerations:
				- Objects will not be deallocated automatically
				- Must explicitly unregister objects or clear the registry to free memory
				- Can lead to memory accumulation if not properly managed
				- Use clearAllRegisteredObjects: to bulk-remove objects when needed
 
				Example usage:
				```objc
				BEStorageObjectRegistry *registry = [[BEStorageObjectRegistry alloc] init];
				NSMutableArray *data = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:@"item1", @"item2", nil];
				NSString *uuid = [registry registerObject:data];
				data = nil; // Object is still retained by registry

				// retrievedData is still valid and contains the original data
