 @author		belisoful@icloud.com
 @abstract		A comprehensive system for adding and managing dynamic methods to Objective-C objects at runtime using blocks.
 @discussion	This header provides a powerful runtime method injection system that allows you to add methods to existing objects
				and classes using blocks. The system supports both instance methods (added to specific object instances) and
				class methods (added to all instances of a class).
				
				Key Features:
				- Add methods to existing objects without subclassing
				- Support for both instance-specific and class-wide dynamic methods
				- Protocol-based method forwarding and delegation
				- Automatic method signature generation from block signatures
				- Optional selector capture for method implementations
				- Thread-safe method management with proper synchronization
				- Memory management with automatic cleanup
				
				## Block Signature Requirements
				
				Method implementation blocks must follow this format:
				```
				ReturnType (^)(id self, SEL _cmd, ...parameters)
				```
				
				The `SEL _cmd` parameter is optional. If included, the block will receive the selector
				of the method being called. If omitted, the system automatically adjusts the signature.
				
				## Activation and Inheritance
				
				Dynamic methods must be explicitly enabled on a per-class basis. Classes can inherit
				dynamic method capabilities from their superclasses or explicitly enable/disable them.
				
				## Limitations
				
				NSMethodSignatures cannot properly encode compiler SIMD, vector, or NEON parameter types and will fail.
				Use their base types as arrays or pointers instead for arguments.
				The `_Float16` type also produces errors for malformed Block Signatures.
				
				## Usage Example
				
				```objc
				// Enable dynamic methods for a class
				[MyClass enableDynamicMethods];
				
				// Add a dynamic method to a specific object
				NSString *str = @"Hello";
				[str addObjectMethod:@selector(customMethod:) block:^(id self, NSString *param) {
					NSLog(@"Called with: %@", param);
					return [self stringByAppendingString:param];
				}];
				
				// Add a dynamic method to all instances of a class
				[NSString addInstanceMethod:@selector(globalMethod) block:^(id self) {
					return @"Global method called";
				}];
				
				// Add protocol-based forwarding
				[MyClass addInstanceProtocol:@protocol(MyProtocol) withClass:[MyHandler class]];
				```
