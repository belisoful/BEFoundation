 @abstract		This provides differentiable versions of NSCharacterSet and NSMutableCharacterSet.
 @discussion	BECharacterSet is a replacement for NSCharacterSet, and BEMutableCharacterSet is a
				replacement for NSMutableCharacterSet.
 
				There is no way to programmatically differentiate a NSCharacterSet from a
				NSMutableCharacterSet because both contain the NSCharacterSet and NSMutableCharacterSet
				as a subclass. As in, instancing a NSCharacterSet will result in a NSMutableCharacterSet.
 
				The BECharacterSet replacement is to provide similar differentiation as NSString vs
				NSMutableString, ensuring clear type safety and mutability contracts.

				membership tests.
 
				BECharacterSet conforms to NSCopying, NSMutableCopying, and NSSecureCoding protocols,
				making it suitable for use in collections, copying operations, and secure archiving.
