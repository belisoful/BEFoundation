 @category		BExtension
 @abstract		Adds set mapping, filtering, and object meta functionality.
 @discussion	This category provides map, filter, and objects meta-date
				methods.
 
 The following methods are provided by this category to `NSSet`:
 
 `-map:`: Maps all objects to a new set, removing `NULL` mappings and not passing.
 
 `-objectsClasses`:  Gets and counts  the `Class` of the objects in the set.
 
 `-objectsClassNames`:  Gets and counts  the `className` of the objects in the set.
 
 `-objectsUniqueClasses`:  Gets and counts  the `Class` of the objects in the set.
 
 `-objectsUniqueClassNames`:  Gets and counts  the `className` of the objects in the set.
 
 `-toClassesFromStrings`: Converts a set of `NSString` into their `Class`.
 
 The following methods are provided by this category to `NSMutableSet`:
 
 `-filter:`: filters all objects to a different set, removing `NULL` mappings
			 and not passing.
 
 These methods provide mapping and class conversion to `NSSet` and filter for
 `NSMutableSet`
