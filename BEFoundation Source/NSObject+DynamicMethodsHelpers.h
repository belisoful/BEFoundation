 * @abstract Helper classes and utilities for the dynamic method injection system.
 * @discussion This header provides the underlying infrastructure for the dynamic method
 *             injection system, including method swizzling management, signature parsing,
 *             and protocol introspection utilities. These components work together to
 *             enable safe and efficient runtime method injection.
 *
 *             The helper classes handle the complex low-level operations required for
 *             dynamic method management, including:
 *             - Method signature conversion between blocks and Objective-C methods
 *             - Safe method swizzling with state tracking
 *             - Protocol hierarchy traversal
 *             - NSInvocation manipulation for proper argument forwarding
 *
 *             This is an internal header that supports the public NSObject+DynamicMethods
 *             category. Direct use of these classes is not recommended unless you need
 *             low-level control over the dynamic method system.

 *             NSInvocation objects to work with block-based method implementations.
 *

 *             that arguments are properly marshaled between the original method call and

 *             handling of the implicit self and _cmd parameters.
 *
 *             The method validates that the input is actually a block and extracts the
 *             raw signature information before performing the conversion. It supports
 *             both blocks that capture the selector parameter and those that don't.

 * @discussion This method creates a new NSInvocation that matches the block's signature
 *             and properly marshals arguments from the original method call to the block.
 *             It handles the optional selector capture feature by adjusting argument
 *             indices appropriately.
 *
 *             The transformation process includes:
 *             - Validating argument count compatibility between method and block signatures
 *             - Creating a new invocation with the block's signature

 *             - Adjusting for the optional selector parameter
 *             - Preserving argument retention state
 *
 *             This method is used internally during method forwarding to ensure that
 *             dynamic methods receive arguments in the format expected by their block
 *             implementations.
