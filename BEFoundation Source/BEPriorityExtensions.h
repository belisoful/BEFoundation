@abstract A comprehensive priority-based sorting framework for Foundation collections.
@discussion This header provides protocols and categories that enable priority-based sorting
for Foundation collection classes. Objects can implement priority protocols to participate
in automatic sorting operations, with fallback mechanisms for objects that don't initially
have priority values.

The framework supports three main use cases:
- Read-only priority items that expose their priority through BEPriorityItem
- Mutable priority items that can capture and store priority values via BEPriorityCapture
- Full priority property support combining both read and write capabilities through BEPriorityProperty

Collection extensions are provided for NSArray, NSMutableArray, NSOrderedSet, and NSMutableOrderedSet
to enable seamless priority-based sorting operations.

@protocol BEPriorityItem
@abstract Protocol for objects that can provide a priority value for sorting operations.
@discussion Objects conforming to this protocol expose a read-only priority property that
can be used by sorting algorithms. The priority value should be consistent across multiple
calls for the same object state.

Priority values are compared using NSNumber's compare: method, where lower numeric values
represent higher priority in the sorted result.

Lower numeric values indicate higher priority in sort order.

This protocol should only implement the setter for itemPriority, not the getter.

@discussion This class property returns a NSComparator block that can be used with Foundation
sorting methods. The comparator handles objects conforming to BEPriorityItem and BEPriorityCapture
protocols, automatically assigning default priority values when needed.

The comparator performs the following logic:
1. Checks if objects conform to BEPriorityItem and retrieves their priority
2. For objects without priority that conform to BEPriorityCapture, assigns the default priority
3. Falls back to the default priority for objects that don't conform to either protocol
4. Compares the resulting priority values using NSNumber's compare: method

@return A NSComparator block suitable for use with Foundation sorting methods.
