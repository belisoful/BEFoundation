/*!
 * @class BEPathWatcher
 * @abstract A class to monitor file system paths for changes using Grand Central Dispatch.
 * @discussion This class uses GCD's dispatch sources to monitor a file or directory for various types of changes. It provides three mechanisms for receiving notifications: blocks, target-action selectors, and protocol methods. The watcher automatically starts monitoring when both a path and callback mechanism are configured.
 *
 * ## Usage Examples
 *
 * **Block-based monitoring:**
 * ```objc
 * BEPathWatcher *watcher = [BEPathWatcher watcherForPath:@"/path/to/watch"
 *                                             withBlock:^(BEPathWatcher *w, unsigned long flags) {
 *     NSLog(@"Path changed: %@", w.path);
 * }];
 * ```
 *
 * **Target-action monitoring:**
 * ```objc
 * BEPathWatcher *watcher = [BEPathWatcher watcherForPath:@"/path/to/watch"
 *                                               target:self
 *                                             selector:@selector(pathChanged:)];
 * ```
 *
 * The watcher automatically handles cleanup when the watched path is deleted or renamed.
