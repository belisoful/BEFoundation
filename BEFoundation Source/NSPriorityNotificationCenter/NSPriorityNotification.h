 @class			NSPriorityNotification
 @superclass	NSNotification
 @abstract		A notification class that extends NSNotification with priority-based processing capabilities.
 @discussion	NSPriorityNotification adds enhanced functionality to the standard notification system:
 
				- **Reverse Processing**: Observers can be processed in reverse order using the `reverse` property
				- **Post-Processing Blocks**: Each notification can have a block that executes after each observer
				- **Priority Support**: Designed to work with NSPriorityNotificationCenter for priority-based observer management
				- **Secure Coding**: Full support for NSSecureCoding protocol
				- **Global Registry**: Supports object persistence through global registry system
 
				@code
				// Create a reverse-order notification
				NSPriorityNotification *notification = [NSPriorityNotification
					notificationWithName:@"MyNotification"
					object:self
					reverse:YES];
				
				// Create notification with post-processing block
				NSPriorityNotification *notification = [NSPriorityNotification
					notificationWithName:@"MyNotification"
					object:self
					postBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {
						NSLog(@"Processed notification: %@", note.name);
					}];

 @property		reverse
 @abstract		Determines whether observers should be processed in reverse order.
 @discussion	When set to YES, the notification center will process observers in reverse order

 @note			This property is read-only and must be set during initialization.

 @property		postBlock

				- Logging observer execution
				- Cleanup operations
				- State validation
				- Performance monitoring
 @note			The block is copied during initialization and released during deallocation.
