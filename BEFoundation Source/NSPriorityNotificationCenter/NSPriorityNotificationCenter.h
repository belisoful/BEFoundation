 @abstract      A priority-based notification center that allows observers to be notified in order of priority
 @discussion    This class extends NSNotificationCenter to support priority-based notification delivery.
				Observers with higher priority (lower numerical values) are notified first.
				
				Priority values work like Unix process priorities where:
				- Negative values (-20 to -1) have the highest priority
				- Zero (0) has neutral priority
				- Positive values (1 to 20) have lower priority
				- Default priority is 10
				
				The notification center maintains backward compatibility with NSNotificationCenter
				while adding priority-based ordering and additional posting options like reverse
				ordering and post-processing blocks.
