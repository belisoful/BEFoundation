 @brief         Protocols and categories for object mutability and recursive copying of collections.
 @discussion    This header provides a comprehensive framework for determining object mutability and
				performing recursive copying operations on Foundation collections. It defines protocols
				to categorize objects based on their mutability characteristics and provides methods
				for deep copying of complex data structures.
				
				The framework includes five main protocols:
				- BEHasMutable: For classes that have mutable counterparts
				- BEMutable: For classes that are inherently mutable
				- BECollectionAbstract: For all collection classes (both mutable and immutable)
				- BECollection: For immutable collection classes
				- BEMutableCollection: For mutable collection classes
				
				Additionally, it provides recursive copying methods that can create both immutable
				and mutable deep copies of nested data structures.
				
				@note This implementation addresses the unique behavior of NSCharacterSet and
				NSMutableCharacterSet, which cannot be programmatically distinguished due to
				Apple's implementation. The framework provides BECharacterSet and BEMutableCharacterSet
				as replacements for clearer type distinction.

 @protocol      BECollectionAbstract
 @brief         Abstract protocol defining recursive copying operations for all collection classes.
 @discussion    This protocol serves as the foundation for all collection classes, both mutable
				and immutable, by defining the interface for recursive copying operations. It
				provides the core functionality that enables traversal of nested data structures
				and creation of deep copies.
				
				This protocol is inherited by both BECollection and BEMutableCollection, making
				it the common base for all collection types in the framework. It ensures that
				all collection classes provide consistent recursive copying behavior regardless
				of their mutability.
				
				The protocol supports four types of recursive copying:
				1. Complete immutable copying (copyRecursive)
				2. Collection-only immutable copying (copyCollectionRecursive)
				3. Complete mutable copying (mutableCopyRecursive)
				4. Collection-only mutable copying (mutableCopyCollectionRecursive)
				
				Classes that conform to this protocol (through BECollection or BEMutableCollection):
				- NSSet / NSMutableSet
				- NSOrderedSet / NSMutableOrderedSet
				- NSArray / NSMutableArray
				- NSDictionary / NSMutableDictionary

@category      BEMutableCharacterSet(BEMutableProtocol)
@abstract      A category that extends BEMutableCharacterSet to conform to the BEMutable protocol.
@discussion    This category provides runtime mutability detection for BEMutableCharacterSet instances.
			   
			   NSCharacterSet and NSMutableCharacterSet share the same underlying implementation, with NSMutableCharacterSet
			   being a subclass of NSCharacterSet. This architectural design makes it impossible to differentiate between
			   mutable and immutable character sets programmatically using standard Foundation methods.
			   
			   The BEMutableCharacterSet category addresses this limitation by implementing the BEMutable protocol,
			   providing consistent mutability detection across all BE framework classes. This ensures that applications
			   can reliably determine the mutability state of character set instances at runtime.
			   
			   ## Usage
			   
			   Use the `isMutable` method to determine whether a character set instance supports mutation operations:
			   
			   ```objc
			   BEMutableCharacterSet *mutableSet = [[BEMutableCharacterSet alloc] init];
			   BOOL canMutate = [mutableSet isMutable]; // Returns YES
			   ```
			   
			   This category maintains consistency with other mutable/immutable class pairs in the BE framework,
			   such as NSString/NSMutableString, ensuring predictable behavior across all collection types.
