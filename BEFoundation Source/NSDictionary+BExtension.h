@abstract		A comprehensive extension to NSDictionary and NSMutableDictionary providing advanced collection manipulation, indexed subscripting, and recursive merging capabilities.
@discussion		This extension adds powerful functional programming methods to NSDictionary and NSMutableDictionary, including indexed access, object class inspection, dictionary mapping and filtering, and sophisticated recursive merging operations. The extension is designed to enhance the native Foundation dictionary classes with commonly needed operations while maintaining Apple's design patterns and conventions.
